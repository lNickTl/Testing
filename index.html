            <h2>Description lists</h2>
            <p>
                 Descrition lists are used for any type<br>
                 of name/ value pairs, such as terms<br>
                 and their definitions, questions and <br>
                 answers, or other types of terms and <br>
                 their associated information. Their <br>
                 structure is a bit differennt from the <br>
                 other two lists that we discussed. <br>
                 The whole description list is marked <br>
                 up as a <b>dl</b> element. The content of a <br>
                 <b>dl</b> is some number of <b>dt</b> elements<br>
                 indicating the names and <b>dd</b> <br>
                 elements for their respective values. I <br>
                 find it helpful to think of them  as <br>
                 "terms"(to remember the "t" in <b>dt</b>)<br>
                 and "definitions" (for the "d" in <b>dd</b>),<br>
                 even though that is only one use of<br>
                 description lists in HTML5. For<br>
                 example:
            </p>
            <dt class="begin-path">beginPath()</dt>
            <dd> Creates a new path. Once<br>
                 created, future drawing<br>
                 commands are directed into the<br>
                 path and used to build the path<br>
                 up.
            </dd>
            <dt><u><FONT COLOR="#001fe6"> Path methods</u>().</FONT></dt>
            <dd> Methods to set different paths for<br>
            objects
            </dd>
            <dt><u><FONT COLOR="#001fe6">closePath</u>().</FONT></dt>
            <dd>Adds a straight line to the path,<br>
            going to the current sub-path.</dd>
